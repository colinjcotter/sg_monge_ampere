abstract = {We propose a numerical method to find the optimal transport map between a measure supported on a lower-dimensional subset of R{\^{}}d and a finitely supported measure. More precisely, the source measure is assumed to be supported on a simplex soup, i.e. on a union of simplices of arbitrary dimension between 2 and d. As in [Aurenhammer, Hoffman, Aronov, Algorithmica 20 (1), 1998, 61--76] we recast this optimal transport problem as the resolution of a non-linear system where one wants to prescribe the quantity of mass in each cell of the so-called Laguerre diagram. We prove the convergence with linear speed of a damped Newton's algorithm to solve this non-linear system. The convergence relies on two conditions: (i) a genericity condition on the point cloud with respect to the simplex soup and (ii) a (strong) connectedness condition on the support of the source measure defined on the simplex soup. Finally, we apply our algorithm in R{\^{}}3 to compute optimal transport plans between a measure supported on a triangulation and a discrete measure. We also detail some applications such as optimal quantization of a probability density over a surface, remeshing or rigid point set registration on a mesh.},

abstract = {The shallow-water equations are supplemented by a moisture equation in order to model effects of latent heat release on the horizontal propagation of disturbances. Since latent heating in regions of upward motion compensates the reduction in perturbation temperature due to lifting, buoyancy effects are reduced and disturbances propagate more slowly. Analytic solutions are obtained to illustrate this effect, a good example being provided by the collapse of an initial horizontal temperature discontinuity. Another interesting example is provided by the case of disturbances propagating through a region from one side. Moist regions are found to have front and rear boundaries which both move faster than rainbands do inside the moist region. If random disturbances are passed through a region which is initially saturated, the relative humidity drops until it reaches a value which depends on the disturbance level.},

abstract = {Abstract The linear Eady model of baroclinic instability with the geostrophic momentum (GM) approximation is solved analytically in physical space and shown to be identical to linear three-dimensional semigeostrophic theory. Both the growth rates and the wavenumber of the short-wave cutoff are larger than those predicted by quasi-geostrophic (QG) theory. This behavior arises because the effective static stability is reduced in the GM case. These results are opposite to those using standard nongeostrophic (NG) theory, and the discrepancy increases with decreasing Richardson number. Energetically, the unstable GM normal modes enhance the conversion of available potential energy compared to the QG modes and also convert available kinetic energy to eddy kinetic energy. With regards to the structure of the unstable modes, the northward tilt with height in the GM case is more consistent with NG theory than is the QG solution which displays no meridional tilt. Additional analysis addresses the effect of assuming...},

abstract = {A vertical slice model is developed for the Euler–Boussinesq equations with a constant temperature gradient in the direction normal to the slice (the Eady–Boussinesq model). The model is a solution of the full three-dimensional equations with no variation normal to the slice, which is an idealised problem used to study the formation and subsequent evolution of weather fronts. A compatible finite element method is used to discretise the governing equations. To extend the Charney–Phillips grid staggering in the compatible finite element framework, we use the same node locations for buoyancy as the vertical part of velocity and apply a transport scheme for a partially continuous finite element space. For the time discretisation, we solve the semi-implicit equations together with an explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge–Kutta scheme to all of the advection terms. The model reproduces several quasi-periodic lifecycles of fronts despite the presence of strong discontinuities. An asymptotic limit analysis based on the semi-geostrophic theory shows that the model solutions are converging to a solution in cross-front geostrophic balance. The results are consistent with the previous results using finite difference methods, indicating that the compatible finite element method is performing as well as finite difference methods for this test problem. We observe dissipation of kinetic energy of the cross-front velocity in the model due to the lack of resolution at the fronts, even though the energy loss is not likely to account for the large gap on the strength of the fronts between the model result and the semi-geostrophic limit solution.},

Previous work by proves that the semigeostrophic equations can be solved in the cases, respectively, of 3-dimensional (3-d) incompressible flow between rigid boundaries, vertically averaged 3-d incom-pressible flow with a free surface, and fully compressible flow. However, all these results prove only the existence of weak solutions in "dual" variables, where the dual variables result from a change of variables introduced by Hoskins. This makes it difficult to relate the solutions to the full Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, or to those of other simple atmosphere/ocean models. We therefore seek to extend these results to prove existence of a solution in physical variables. We do this using the Lagrangian form of the equations in physical space. The proof is based on the recent results of L. Ambrosio on transport equations and ODE for BV vector fields. 1. Introduction. The semigeostrophic equations are a simple model of large-scale atmosphere/ocean flows, where "large-scale" is defined to mean that the flow is rotation-dominated [4]. They are also accurate in the case where one horizontal scale becomes small, allowing them to describe weather fronts and jet streams. Previous work by Benamou and Brenier [2], Cullen and Gangbo [5], and Cullen and Maroofi [6] proves that the semigeostrophic equations can be solved in the cases, respectively, of 3-dimensional (3-d) incompressible flow between rigid boundaries, vertically averaged 3-d incompressible flow with a free surface, and fully compressible flow. However, all these results only prove the existence of weak solutions in "dual" variables, where the dual variables result from the change of variables introduced by [11]. This makes it difficult to relate the solutions to the full Euler or Navier-Stokes equations, or to those of other simple atmosphere/ocean models. We therefore seek to extend the results of [2] and [5] to prove existence of a solution in physical variables. We do this using the Lagrangian form of the equations in physical space. The proof is based on the recent results of L. Ambrosio [1] on transport equations and ODE for BV vector fields. It is not clear whether it is possible to prove existence of a weak solution to the Eulerian form of the equations. The transport theory of [1] gives uniqueness. However, the analysis of [2], [5], and [6] does not give uniqueness, because of the dependence of the transport velocity on the transported quantity. This question remains open.},

abstract = {Abstract The semi-geostrophic equations are used to study the baroclinic instability of jet flows having zero potential vorticity gradient. Normal modes of the linear problems are obtained and it is shown that the most unstable modes tend to tilt in the horizontal with the ambient shears of the basic zonal flows. These most unstable modes are used as initial conditions for integrations of the nonlinear equations. When an upper westerly jet is present, the slightly unrealistic frontogenesis in the Eady mode independent of y (Hoskins and Bretherton, 1972) becomes a realistic cold front development. As the wave grows further a warm front is produced. The same solution may be used for baroclinic growth on a flow with positive vorticity at the surface on the equatorial side of the mode. This exhibits the development of a very different sort of warm front. No cold front is produced. The three kinds of frontogenesis found in these models are analyzed, with emphasis being placed on 1) the ageostrophic horizontal ...},

Both inviscid frontogenesis prior to frontal collapse and frontogenesis with horizontal diffusion following collapse are considered. The numerical solutions generally agree well with semigeostrophic ({\{}SG){\}} theory, though differences can be substantial for intense fronts. Certain deviations from {\{}SG{\}} that have been previously discussed in the literature area, upon closer examination, associated with spurious gravity waves produced by inadequate resolution or by the initialization of the numerical model. Even when spurious waves are eliminated, however, significant deviations from {\{}SG{\}} still exist: gravity waves are emitted by the frontogenesis when the cross-front scale becomes sufficiently small, and higher-order corrections to {\{}SG{\}} may also be present. In the postcollapse solutions (where they are most prominent), the emitted waves are stationary with respect to the front and lead to a band of increased low-level ascent just ahead of the surface front. It is suggested here that, when small, the deviations from {\{}SG{\}} arise as the linear forced response to the cross-front accelerations neglected by {\{}SG.{\}}},

Among the several algorithms proposed to solve semi-discrete optimal transport problems, one currently needs to choose between algorithms that are slow but come with a convergence speed analysis (e.g. Oliker-Prussner) or algorithms that are much faster in practice but which come with no convergence guarantees Algorithms of the first kind rely on coordinate-wise increments and the number of iterations required to reach the solution up to an error of {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} is of order {\$}N{\^{}}3/\backslashepsilon{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of Dirac masses in the target measure. On the other hand, algorithms of the second kind typically rely on the formulation of the semi-discrete optimal transport problem as an unconstrained convex optimization problem which is solved using a Newton or quasi-Newton method. The purpose of this article is to bridge this gap between theory and practice by introducing a damped Newton's algorithm which is experimentally efficient and by proving the global convergence of this algorithm with optimal rates. The main assumptions is that the cost function satisfies a condition that appears in the regularity theory for optimal transport (the Ma-Trudinger-Wang condition) and that the support of the source density is connected in a quantitative way (it must satisfy a weighted Poincar$\backslash$'e-Wirtinger inequality).},

In a previous paper, the authors showed that the PE and the SG models can have significantly different versions of the large-scale dynamics—here they report on the implications of this difference for frontogenesis. The program for the study of frontogenesis developed by B. J. Hoskins and collaborators is followed to show how, in the PE version of the canonical cases, the surface warm front develops before the cold front, and why the upper-level front is a long, nearly continuous feature going from ridge to trough. The frontogenesis experienced by an air parcel is computed following the parcel to illustrate better the mechanisms involved. As the present calculations are carried out longer than most previous ones, the relation of the upper frontogenesis to the formation of the upper-level “cutoff” cyclone is also examined.

A transformation of horizontal coordinates products the “semi-geostrophic” system in which conservation of potential vorticity and potential temperature suffice to determine the motion.

A certain Jacobian matrix is required to be positive-definite if solution of the semigeostrophic equations is to be well posed. formally, this gives three conditions which must be satisfied, one of which corresponds to the positivity of the semigeostrophic potential vorticity defined as the determinant of the matrix. The full implications of these stability criteria are sought here, together with some simple expression of the positive-definite requirement. The existence of a minimum energy principle, with respect to virtual parcel displacements which conserve absolute momentum and potential temperature is shown to play a key role, as in the equivalent circular vortex problem studied by Fj{\"{o}}rtoft. It also appears to provide the basis for extending semigeostrophic theory to the general geophysical situation in which the gravitation vector and axis of rotation are not colinear.},

abstract = {This book counteracts the current fashion for theories of "chaos" and unpredictability by describing a theory that underpins the surprising accuracy of current deterministic weather forecasts, and it suggests that further improvements are possible. The book does this by making a unique link between an exciting new branch of mathematics called "optimal transportation" and existing classical theories of the large-scale atmosphere and ocean circulation. It is then possible to solve a set of simple equations proposed many years ago by Hoskins which are asymptotically valid on large scales, and use them to derive quantitative predictions about many large-scale atmospheric and oceanic phenomena. A particular feature is that the simple equations used have highly predictable solutions, thus suggesting that the limits of deterministic predictability of the weather may not yet have been reached. It is also possible to make rigorous statements about the large-scale behaviour of the atmosphere and ocean by proving results using these simple equations and applying them to the real system allowing for the errors in the approximation. There are a number of other titles in this field, but they do not treat this large-scale regime.

The derived solutions are valid for an extended period following the critical time that the inviscid solution for the cross-frontal geostrophic velocity v becomes discontinuous. This discontinuous behavior is removed by momentum diffusion. The evolution of frontal development is described until equilibration is attained, a quasi-steady state exists, or until decay occurs. Principal features of the solutions are the lifting of the warm sector above the ground, and the interplay between unstable growth of the baroclinic Eady wave and momentum diffusion that acts as a dissipative mechanism. The semigeostrophic ageostrophic circulation is characterized by a broad clockwise cell.

This method can be used to resolve evolving small scale features in the flow.

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

In the moving cold front, the vertical shear of the synoptic wind which advects the front produces an ageostrophic residue as a result of the differential advection of the vertical shear of the frontal jet and the horizontal temperature gradient across the front. This residue, which depends upon the vertical synoptic shear and the thermal wind structure of the frontal system, will generate a cross-stream circulation which maintains the cold front in a quasi-steady state.

Non-Boussinesq, non-uniform potential vorticity, latent heat, and surface friction effects are all studied. Using a two-region fluid we model the effects of confluence near the tropopause. A similar approach is made to the appearance of fronts in the finite-amplitude development of the simplest Eady wave; this is also solved analytically. Based on the surface fronts produced by these models, we give a general model of a strong surface front. There is a tendency to form discontinuities in a finite time.},

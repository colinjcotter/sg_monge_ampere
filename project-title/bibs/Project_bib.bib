abstract = {We propose a numerical method to find the optimal transport map between a measure supported on a lower-dimensional subset of R{\^{}}d and a finitely supported measure. More precisely, the source measure is assumed to be supported on a simplex soup, i.e. on a union of simplices of arbitrary dimension between 2 and d. As in [Aurenhammer, Hoffman, Aronov, Algorithmica 20 (1), 1998, 61--76] we recast this optimal transport problem as the resolution of a non-linear system where one wants to prescribe the quantity of mass in each cell of the so-called Laguerre diagram. We prove the convergence with linear speed of a damped Newton's algorithm to solve this non-linear system. The convergence relies on two conditions: (i) a genericity condition on the point cloud with respect to the simplex soup and (ii) a (strong) connectedness condition on the support of the source measure defined on the simplex soup. Finally, we apply our algorithm in R{\^{}}3 to compute optimal transport plans between a measure supported on a triangulation and a discrete measure. We also detail some applications such as optimal quantization of a probability density over a surface, remeshing or rigid point set registration on a mesh.},

abstract = {We derive a moving mesh method based upon ideas from optimal transport theory which is suited to solving PDE problems in meteorology. In particular we show how the Parabolic Monge-Amp{\'{e}}re method for constructing a moving mesh in two-dimensions can be coupled successfully to a pressure correction method for the solution of incompressible flows with significant convection and subject to Coriolis forces. This method can be used to resolve evolving small scale features in the flow. In this paper the method is then applied to the computation of the solution to the Eady problem which is observed to develop large gradients in a finite time. The moving mesh method is shown to work and be stable, and to give significantly better resolution of the evolving singularity than a fixed, uniform mesh. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Cullen2008,
abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

@article{Kitagawa2016,
abstract = {Many problems in geometric optics or convex geometry can be recast as optimal transport problems: this includes the far-field reflector problem, Alexandrov's curvature prescription problem, etc. A popular way to solve these problems numerically is to assume that the source probability measure is absolutely continuous while the target measure is finitely supported. We refer to this setting as semi-discrete optimal transport. Among the several algorithms proposed to solve semi-discrete optimal transport problems, one currently needs to choose between algorithms that are slow but come with a convergence speed analysis (e.g. Oliker-Prussner) or algorithms that are much faster in practice but which come with no convergence guarantees Algorithms of the first kind rely on coordinate-wise increments and the number of iterations required to reach the solution up to an error of {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} is of order {\$}N{\^{}}3/\backslashepsilon{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of Dirac masses in the target measure. On the other hand, algorithms of the second kind typically rely on the formulation of the semi-discrete optimal transport problem as an unconstrained convex optimization problem which is solved using a Newton or quasi-Newton method. The purpose of this article is to bridge this gap between theory and practice by introducing a damped Newton's algorithm which is experimentally efficient and by proving the global convergence of this algorithm with optimal rates. The main assumptions is that the cost function satisfies a condition that appears in the regularity theory for optimal transport (the Ma-Trudinger-Wang condition) and that the support of the source density is connected in a quantitative way (it must satisfy a weighted Poincar$\backslash$'e-Wirtinger inequality).},

@article{Hoskins1975,
abstract = {Abstract Consideration of flows in which the rate of change of momentum is much smaller than the Coriolis force suggests that the advected quantity momentum may be approximated by its geostrophic value but that trajectories cannot be so approximated. The resulting set of equations imply full forms of the equations for potential temperature, three-dimensional vorticity, potential vorticity and energy. A transformation of horizontal coordinates products the “semi-geostrophic” system in which conservation of potential vorticity and potential temperature suffice to determine the motion. The system is capable of describing the formation of fronts, jets, and the growth of baroclinic waves into the nonlinear regime. It sheds some light on the success and failure of the quasi-geostrophic equations.},

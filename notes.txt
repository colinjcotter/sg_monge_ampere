PARAMETER (HP=1.E4,LP=2.E6,THETAP=285.,UP=10.,FP=1.E-4)
      PARAMETER (BP=40.,CP=8.,GP=10.,THETA0P=300.)


      PI=ASIN(1.0)*2.
      ASPECT=(GP*HP/(FP*FP*LP*LP))   !  (GH)/(FL)**2
      Y1=(Y-YBM)/(YBP-YBM)      ! SCALING SO THAT Y1 IS IN (0,1)
      XC=X
      YC=(THETAP+BP*Y1+CP*.2*SIN(PI*(X+Y1)))*ASPECT/THETA0P

THETAP is value of temperature at the bottom (unperturbed) = 285
BP is the vertical temperature difference = 40 here, 7.5 in assumed value

theta = 285 + 40*z/H + 8*sin(pi*(X/L + Y/H))

N^2 = g \theta'/\theta_0 (which is 300) = 2.5e-5

\theta' = 300*N^2/g = 300*2.5e-5/10 = 0.00075
temperature difference = \theta'*H = 7.5 OK

d buoyancy/dy = d theta/dy*g/theta_0
= -3e-6*10/300 = -1.0e-7 OK

There seems to be a discrepancy between the value of BP in the
geometric model code, which gives a theta difference of 40 degrees
between top and bottom in the basic state, and that consistent with
the assumed value of N^2, which would give a difference of 7.5. In
Nakamura (1994) the vertical difference of theta is consistent with
the assumed N^2. However, the plots from the geometric model in my
book look like the value of 40 was used (though I can't be sure, i
only have the plot after 8 days and the vertical difference increases
with time.) In Abeed's paper, the quoted constants are the same as in
my book and in Nakamura (1994), but his plots also looks like the
larger vertical difference of theta was used. Probably he followed the
geometric code which I gave you. In Cullen (2008) the compressible
formulation means that the theta profile has to be computed from the
assumed N^2, so would presumably give the smaller value.
